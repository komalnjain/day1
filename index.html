    <P>Welcome to my personal journey in the fascinating world of AI and ML! I am Komal N, a dedicated AIML engineering student at PES College of Engineering, Mandya, currently in my 5th semester. With a strong passion for machine learning, web development, and cybersecurity, I aspire to carve a niche as a Data Scientist and ML Engineer, aiming to join Google by 2025. As the Secretary of the IEEE Student Branch at PESCE, I actively contribute to innovative projects, community initiatives, and skill-building events. My endeavors include creating impactful solutions like a human fall detection system, promoting sustainability through recycling vending machines, and fostering awareness on vital issues like menstrual health. Always eager to learn, I continuously explore technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain while nurturing a vision to merge AI with real-world applications for a brighter, smarter future.</P>
